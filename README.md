# Clusterring

In this study, a hi-rail vehicle is equipped with two non-contact velocity meters, specifically Doppler LiDAR sensors. These sensors are utilized to measure and record the lateral vibration of both the right and left rails throughout a 3.2-mile test.Then, A clustering algorithm is developed to identify loose and healthy spots of the track. The clusters are verfied through other methods to prove the accuracy of the model
